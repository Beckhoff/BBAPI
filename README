The Beckhoff BIOS API linux driver is implemented in two layers.
The kernel module 'bbapi' represents the bottom layer, which communicates
directly to the BIOS. The upper interface of 'bbapi' is based on ioctl's
and IndexGroups and IndexOffsets defined in the "Beckhoff BIOS-API manual".

On top of 'bbapi' a second layer is implemented to provide a linux interface
based on device files. 'bbapi_disp' and 'bbapi_wdt' implement this second
layer. Both depend on an installed 'bbapi' module.
'bbapi_disp' implements virtual terminal like interface to the CX2100 text display
'bbapi_wdt' implements a common watchdog interface to the CX hw watchdog


How to build and install the kernel modules:
============================================
Install 'bbapi'
1. cd into bbapi <src_dir>
2. make && make install

Install 'bbapi_disp'
1. make sure 'bbapi' is already installed
2. cd into <src_dir>/display
3. make && make install

Install 'bbapi_wdt'
1. make sure 'bbapi' is already installed
2. cd into <src_dir>/watchdog
3. make && make install


How to access the bbapi:
========================
"/dev/bbapi" is the device file to access the low level BBAPI
-- see "Beckhoff BIOS-API manual" and unittest.cpp for more details.

"/dev/cx_display" is the device file to access the CX2100 text display.
-- see display_example.cpp for detailed information

"/dev/watchdog" is the device file to access the CX hardware watchdog.
-- See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt
