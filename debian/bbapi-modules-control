Description: Beckhoff BIOS API for linux-image-KERNEL_VERSION
 The BIOS-API is a piece of software which is part of the BIOS in Beckhoff
 industrial motherboards. It offers a one-stop solution for communicating
 with several components on the board, such as temperature and voltage sensors,
 the S-USV microcontroller, the PWRCTRL microcontroller, the Watchdog and other
 components (if installed). It also offers access to a small memory area in the
 EEPROM reserved for user data. the API is integrated into the BIOS. The OS
 which is running on the board needs to have a special Device Driver installed
 to access the API functions. Through this driver the user software can take
 advantage of the API functionality.
 This package contains BBAPI drivers for the KERNEL_VERSION Linux kernel,
 built from bbapi-dkms for the amd64 architecture.
